**Features**
**Short Menu:** The web application features a concise yet mouthwatering menu that showcases the delicious taco options available for catering events. Customers can quickly browse through the menu items, enticing them with the flavors of authentic Mexican cuisine.

**Catering Request Form:** We understand the importance of personalized service, which is why the web application includes a user-friendly form for customers to submit their catering requests. The form allows customers to specify event details, select menu items, and provide any additional preferences or dietary requirements.

**Order Management:** Once a catering request is submitted, the application provides an intuitive interface for the business owners to manage and track orders. They can review and respond to each request, ensuring seamless communication and efficient coordination with their customers.

**Technologies Used**
Front-end: The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing user interface. The design is responsive and optimized for various devices, allowing customers to easily access the application from their desktops, tablets, or mobile phones.

**Back-end:** To handle the form submissions and data management, the application utilizes Express, a server-side scripting language. 

Database: The catering requests and order data are stored in a database, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval. A relational database management system called MongoDB is used to securely store and manage the information.
